    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve heard it claimed that the AMRAP sets in the 5/3/1 training program are not required.
This is wrong for the original 5/3/1 program, and anyone avoiding the AMRAP sets will
make no real progress and eventually stall.</p>
<p>Its true that AMRAPs are not necessary for many of the variants of &ldquo;531&rdquo; as proposed by Jim Wendler,
but these are not Classic 531 - they are a handful of programs that follow the Training Max principle
and an 85/90/95% intensity scheme. The 5/3/1 rep scheme is not essential to Wendler&rsquo;s current programs.</p>
<p>Following Classic 531, we set our Training Max (TM) at 85% (or 90%, whatever) of our True 1 Rep Max.
For each of the main lifts, we follow this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: 65%/75%/85%TM 5/5/5+</li>
<li>Week 2: 70%/80%/90%TM 3/3/3+</li>
<li>Week 3: 75%/85%/95%TM 5/3/1+</li>
<li>Week 4: Deload (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice <em>you will always do more than the prescribed number</em>, otherwise your Training Max is way too high. If you stop at 5, 3 or 1 reps, when you could easily do 10, 8 or 5 <em>you are not doing enough work to make progress</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll restate this without the AMRAP sets, and with the percents shown as a percent of our True Max, using a TM of 85%:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: 55%/63%/72% 5/5/5</li>
<li>Week 2: 60%/68%/77% 3/3/3</li>
<li>Week 3: 63%/72%/81% 5/3/1</li>
<li>Week 4: Deload (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will not make progress by doing a single 1 rep set at 81% of your true max, or by doing 3x3 of a medium weight, once every 3-4 weeks. There is simply not enough volume at the intensities we&rsquo;re using. You will slowly detrain from this.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to do AMRAPs, you should follow one of Wendler&rsquo;s later programs (from 5/3/1 Beyond or 5/3/1 Forever) which use 5&rsquo;s Pro (5/5/5 every week) and throw in a lot of extra work to make up for the lack of AMRAPs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re short on time, I suggest you stick with classic 5/3/1+ (or 5&rsquo;s PRO with AMRAP on the last set). If you have a little more time and energy, add another AMRAP set using the first set&rsquo;s weight.</p>
