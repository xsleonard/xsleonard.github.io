      <description>I tried to enroll as an Apple developer and received this error message with no help or guidance from Apple on resolving it:
 Sorry, you canâ€™t enroll at this time. Your Apple ID is already associated with the Account Holder of a membership.
 Googling this error message didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any useful information.
Turned out I had once paid for an Apple developer membership a decade ago and forgot about it.</description>
